# dart_sealed_unions

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This library is a port of [JavaSealedUnions](https://github.com/pakoito/JavaSealedUnions/blob/master/README.md) originally created by [Francisco](https://github.com/pakoito/) ([Paco](https://github.com/pakoito/)) [Est√©vez
](https://github.com/pakoito/).

`Dart` port by [George Medve](https://github.com/nodinosaur) with assistance from [Jan Knotek](https://github.com/JanKn) and [Brian Egan](https://github.com/brianegan).

## RATIONALE
Sealed classes are used for representing restricted class hierarchies, when a value can have one of the types from a limited set, but cannot have any other type. They are, in a sense, an extension of enum classes: the set of values for an enum type is also restricted, but each enum constant exists only as a single instance, whereas a subclass of a sealed class can have multiple instances which can contain state.
Sealed classes are available in languages like [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#sealed-classes), or [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/88c54tsw.aspx). Tagged unions are common on [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Enumerations.html) and [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/enums.html).

We highly recommend reading the [Rationale](https://github.com/pakoito/JavaSealedUnions/blob/master/README.md#rationale) for the readme of [JavaSealedUnions](https://github.com/pakoito/JavaSealedUnions/blob/master/README.md) for an indepth explanation of the idea and application of the library.

## USAGE
The following example project: [MVI Sealed Unions](https://github.com/flutterconsortium/mvi_sealed_unions) demonstrates the library application in a Flutter app.

## INSTALLING
#### 1. Depend on it
Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml

```

#### 2.Install it
You can install packages from the command line:

with Flutter:
```bash
flutter packages get
```
